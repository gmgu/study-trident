# study-trident
This repository is for studying Kakao Brain's Trident, which is an efficient library that can replace some PyTorch components. 


## Contents

- 1_hello_triton: a kernel that prints "Hello Triton Kernel!". explains func\[grid\]() syntax.
- 2_inout_tensor: how to input/output tensors to/from a kernel


## To Be Writen
- 3_performance: measure the performance in terms of elapsed time
- 4_2d_grid: a kernel that handles 2d array
- 5_out_of_index: how to handle out of index problem
- 6_random: using random seed in Triton
- 7_pybind11: how to use C++ code in Python
